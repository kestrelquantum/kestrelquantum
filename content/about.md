We are a group of quantum optimal control researchers and software engineers looking to bring the best quantum control software to many prominent quantum hardware platforms.

Many of the innovations in modern control techniques, often seen in robotics applications, bear deep relevance to controlling qubits of today's quantum computers. To control qubits to apply computational gates with the highest fidelity, shortest time, all while respecting the limits of our hardware requires solving difficult problems. Leveraging ___ techniques, solutions to these problems can be found and further optimized through expirimentation. 

Improving the fidelity of gate operations will bring more scalable, fault-tolerant, and possibly error-corrected quantum chips closer to today.
